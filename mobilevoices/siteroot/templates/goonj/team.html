<h1>Our Team</h1>

	
	<p>

The Goonj network is operated by Gram Vaani Community Media. Gram Vaani, meaning 'voice of the village', is a social technology company based at IIT Delhi. We started in 2009 with the intent of reversing the flow of information, that is, to make it bottom-up instead of top-down. Using simple technologies and social context to design tools, we have been able to impact communities at large - more than 2 million users in over 7 Indian States, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Namibia and South Africa. More interesting than this are the outcomes of what we have done: Thirty rural radio stations are able to manage and share content over mobiles and the web, corrupt ration shop officials in Jharkhand were arrested due to citizen complaints made on our platform, Women Sarpanches in Uttar Pradesh shared learning and opinions on their work with senior goverment officials, and citizens were able to monitor and report on waste management in 18 wards of Delhi to hold MCD officials accountable for their work.

We have won several awards, including the Knight News Challenge in 2008, the Manthan Awards in 2009, the Economic Times Power of Ideas awards in 2010, the Rockefeller challenge in 2012, the Rising Stars in Global Health award in 2012, the mBillionth South Asia Award in 2012, and were finalists in the Ashoka Changemakers and Vodafone Mobiles for Good competition last year. We work with organizations all across India and in other developing parts of the world.

	<li> &nbsp; - A communication framework over flaky Internet connections to transport pictures, and audio and video clips from the field</li>
	<li> &nbsp; - Android phone applications to send reports on grievances being tracked by volunteers, and moderation of audio recordings by community representatives</li>
